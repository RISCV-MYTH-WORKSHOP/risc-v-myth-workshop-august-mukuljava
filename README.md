# RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop - Building Risc-V core

An informative workshop and project on how to build Risc-V CPU core organized by VSD Corp and Redwood EDA. This workshop helped me learn the basics of RISC-V core and its RV32I instruction set. This workshop was a day by day learning of RISC-V concepts and its practical experience in Open-source tools. Here, we used languages like C, Assembly Language Programming for software implementation and TL-Verilog for HDL implementation. The tools used were: Spike and Makerchip IDE open-source platform developed by Redwood EDA.

# 1. Introduction to RISC-V

RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use. Notable features of the RISC-V ISA include a loadâ€“store architecture, bit patterns to simplify the multiplexers in a CPU, IEEE 754 floating-point, a design that is architecturally neutral, and placing most-significant bits at a fixed location to speed sign extension. In this workshop we learnt the basic concepts of RISC-V architecture and RISC instruction set. We also did hands on C programming, Assembly Language and TL-verilog.

# 2. Day 1: Instruction set architecture

Day 1 was all about the introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU Compiler. We were intrduced to VSD-IAT platform developed by jnaapti. Initially, the oration was given on the overall flow of the architecture. It was like how OS is used as interface between user and the machine. Then the higher level language like C/C++ through compiler is converted to Instructions. Instruction act as an abstract interface between software(program) and hardware. This Interface is called as instruction Set Architecture(ISA). This instruction is converted to Assembly Programming via assembler then into machine(binary format). It is then sent to RTL coding and then to Physical Design Implementation. 

The various types of instructions used in RISC-V :

- **RV64I:** Base Integer Instruction Set, 64-bit. Eg - lui, sd, add, jalr, ld etc.
- **RV64M:** Standard Multiply Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division. Eg - mulw, divw etc.
- **RV64IM:** If any CPU performs base as well as multiply and division it is Base and Mutiple extension. 
- **RV64F and RV64D:** Single and double precision floating point extensions. Eg - fadd.s, fcvt.d.s, fmv.x.d etc

If it includes all the above then: **RV64IMFD**

GNU Compiler is required for RISC-V and simulator. We need to set it up on Ubuntu which is installed in VM Virtual Box for Windows OS. Here we installed GNU compiler and Spike siulator which will be required for debugging as well.

# Labs

Testing with simple codes: Running basic C code to find unsigned highest interger

**1. To compile using RISC-V GNU compiler:**
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o unsignedhighest.o unsignedhighest.c
```

**2. To see AL code or dissembled file:**
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d unsignedhighest.o | less
```

**3. To open debugger:**
```
spike -d pk unsignedhighest.o
```

**4. To decrease the number of instructions we use Ofast instead of O1 in the above command which is used to compile RISC-V:**
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o unsignedhighest.o unsignedhighest.c
```

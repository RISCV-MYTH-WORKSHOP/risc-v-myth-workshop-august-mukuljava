# RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop - Building Risc-V core

An informative workshop and project on how to build Risc-V CPU core organized by VSD Corp and Redwood EDA. This workshop helped me learn the basics of RISC-V core and its RV32I instruction set. This workshop was a day by day learning of RISC-V concepts and its practical experience in Open-source tools. Here, we used languages like C, Assembly Language Programming for software implementation and TL-Verilog for HDL implementation. The tools used were: Spike and Makerchip IDE open-source platform developed by Redwood EDA.
